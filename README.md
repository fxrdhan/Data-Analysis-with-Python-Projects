# Replit project links
- This GitHub repository is used to link the work results for the course certificate.
- All submission files are available in the Replit repository.
- The three scripts in workplace folder are interconnected. `project-name.py` contains the main solution code, which is executed and tested through `main.py`, while `test_module.py` ensures the accuracy of the solution by running automated tests on the code from `project-name.py`.

## How to run
1. Navigate to `main.py` each Repl.
2. Click `Run` to run the code.
