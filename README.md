# Overview
- This GitHub repository links the work results for the Certification Project.
- All submission files are available in the Replit project (Repl).
- The three main scripts in each project folder are interconnected. The `project-name.py` file contains the main solution code, which is executed and tested through `main.py`, while `test_module.py` ensures the accuracy of the solution by running automated tests on the code from `project-name.py`.

## How to run
1. Navigate to `main.py` in each Repl.
2. Click `Run` button to execute the code.
