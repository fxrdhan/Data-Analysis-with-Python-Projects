# Overview
- This GitHub repository links the work results for the Certification Project.
- The three main scripts in each project folder are interconnected. The `project-name.py` file contains the main solution code, which is executed and tested through `main.py`, while `test_module.py` (testing module by freeCodeCamp) ensures the accuracy of the solution by running automated tests on the code from `project-name.py`.
- Notebooks available at Colab, where a modified version of the original Python script to better suit the analysis and visualization process.

## How to run
